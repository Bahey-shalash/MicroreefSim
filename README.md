# MicroreefSim
This repository contains the code for “Projet Microrécif,” a simulation project that models the evolution of micro-organisms in a 2D environment. The project adheres to object-oriented programming principles and utilizes the GTKMM 4 library for graphical interface development.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into three main phases, each building upon the previous one:

1. **Phase 1**:
   - Implementation of the `shape` module for geometric calculations.
   - Reading and error detection of configuration files.
   - Command-line execution: `./projet txx.txt`.

2. **Phase 2**:
   - Development of the GTKMM graphical interface.
   - Initial graphical display and minimal interface functionality.
   - Simulation of algae creation and disappearance.
   - Command-line execution: `./projet test1.txt`.

3. **Phase 3**:
   - Complete simulation with full GTKMM interface.
   - Comprehensive functionality as described in the project specifications.

## Key Features

- **Geometric Calculations**: Implementation of fundamental geometric structures and functions to handle the spatial aspects of the simulation.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error detection and reporting for configuration files.
- **Graphical Interface**: Utilization of GTKMM 4 to create an intuitive and interactive user interface.
- **Simulation Logic**: Management of the life cycles and interactions of algae, corals, and scavengers within a confined 2D space.

- ## Building and Running

To build the project, navigate to the root directory and run:

```sh
make
```

To run the project with a test configuration file:


```sh
./projet txx.txt
```
## Test Files

The test files for the project are located in the public folder.
